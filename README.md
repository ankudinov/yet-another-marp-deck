# Yet Another Marp Demo

This repository is just a simple [Marp](https://marp.app/) demo.
There are many other Marp demos available, this one was only created to show Marp features on an internal meeting.

The VScode devcontainer is provided to guarantee consistent environment with all extensions, including `marp-team.marp-vscode` and dependencies.

To inspect Marp deck source code check `marp_demo.md`.
The deck was also exported using Marp extension for VSCode as pdf `marp_demo.pdf` and HTML `index.html`.
The HTML is also available on [https://ankudinov.github.io/yet-another-marp-deck/](https://ankudinov.github.io/yet-another-marp-deck/)
